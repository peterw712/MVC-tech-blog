# MVC tech blog

## Description

Full-stack application of a blog with CRUD operations and a login feature. 

## Challenges

Cannot get app to work on Heroku but it works locally. I get an internal server error or sequelize refused to connect error. 

## Installation

Install dependencies and create a .env file. Start mysql in the terminal, use schema.sql as a source, ```npm run seed``` in the terminal, run ```npm start```, then go to localhost:3001 in your browser.
